This is a small Windows system tray application that allows you to mute your microphone by clicking on its icon or using a global keyboard shortcut.

The keyboard shortcut is configurable and works from any program. The microphone you want to control can be selected from the list of available microphones, have a look at the right-click menu of the application's system tray icon.

The icon shows the status of the selected microphone, green means active and red means muted. The icon also reacts to microphone status changes made in the Windows audio settings.
